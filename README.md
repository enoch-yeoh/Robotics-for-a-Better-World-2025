# Robotics-for-a-Better-World-2025
My team and I took part in the biannual Robotics for a Better World 2025 organised by my school, Rulang Primary.  
My school sent 3 teams.
This is the last robotics competition before PSLE.
After natural disasters, our versatile robot has fire fighting and debris clearing capabilities, which can be deployed quickly and efficiently.
I came up with the design and the build as I have good experience in building things!
Although we won the Bronze medal, I was happy to also learn from the winning designs!

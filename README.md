# Robotics-for-a-Better-World-2025
We took part for the Rulang Primary's last robotics competition before PSLE.
After natural disasters, our versatile robot has fire fighting and debris clearing capabilities, which can be deployed quickly and efficiently.
I came up with the design and the build as I have good experience in building things!
We won the Bronze medal!
